# PRJ-14 Repository Readme
Project Description
Welcome to the PRJ-14 GitHub repository! This repository contains the project files related to PRJ-14, and it is intended to help organize and manage the development of this project. Please make sure to follow the guidelines and instructions provided in this readme to maintain consistency and clarity within the repository.

Project Files
File Naming Convention
To ensure clarity and consistency, please follow the file naming convention when adding project-related files:

Filename: The filename should be directly related to the content and purpose of the file.
Description: Each file should include a clear and concise description of its contents and purpose.
For example:

user_authentication.py: Python script to handle user authentication.
database_schema.sql: SQL file containing the database schema.
Directory Structure
To maintain an organized project structure, use appropriate directories for different types of files and components. The directory structure should be self-explanatory, and directory names should be lowercase with underscores, following this pattern:

bash
Copy code
- project_root/
  - src/         # Source code files
  - data/        # Data files
  - docs/        # Documentation files
  - tests/       # Test files
Feel free to adapt the directory structure to your project's needs, but please ensure that it remains well-organized and intuitive.

Changing Directory References
In your code and documentation, make sure to specify file and directory paths relative to the repository's root directory. This ensures that the code and references remain accurate, regardless of the repository's location on your local system or when deployed elsewhere.

For example, if you have a Python script located in the src/ directory that needs to access a file in the data/ directory, use a relative path like this:

python
Copy code
# Example Python code in src/my_script.py
import os

data_file_path = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), "../data/data_file.txt")
By using relative paths and os.path.join, your code will adapt to the location of the repository, making it more portable and maintainable.
